Those were my general guidelines, but I may not have always followed them strictly. When working on MTurk, the worse-case scenario is to learn that a requester has grossly understated the amount of time necessary for completion of a HIT, which means that it actually pays a very low hourly wage.     \n",

      "criteria: If a hit is supposed to only take a few seconds, anything more than a minute is really not acceptable.  I was thinking about how low those kinds of batch hits pay, too.  If it is supposed to only take 5 seconds, I'm probably getting only pennies, so I would not keep doing the hit if it was actually taking over a minute on every one.  Also, once you get to the 45 minute mark on a 45 minute hit, anything beyond that is pushing my tolerance.  I might go a few minutes over and not feel cheated, but I will definitely be mad if a 45 minute hit took an hour.  The other concern is how much time you are given on Mturk?  If you have a hit that takes 60 minutes, many requesters only give maybe a 75 or 90 minutes hit timer beyond that, so any time over is risking the hit timing out and not being paid.  There is a little more wiggle room when there is a 15 minute hit where the requester gives a 60 minute standard timer, and I might not be as upset if it goes over, but it really should not be doubled the amount of estimated time no matter what.  Basically, requesters should estimate the time the hit will take on the high side to be more fair.  Finally, I may be more tolerant of an unfairly timed hit if it is a slow day.  On this hit, I just really tried to picture my experience and answer accordingly. \n",

Personally, I could deal with a variance of 5-10 minutes for anything between 45-60 minutes. When you get up to longer hits, that 15 minutes could be a vast difference in hourly pay if it take an additional 15-20 minutes. I have the same feelings for shorter hits. If I calculate earnings for a 1-2 minute hit, and it takes 2-3 more minutes, the hourly rate has decreased drastically. \n",

It's easy to forgive, to use one of your hundred examples, a 30 minute prediction actually taking 37 minutes if the pay is 5 or 6 dollars, but if the job pays 3 or 4 dollars it won't be forgivable. My only real rule was erring on the side of believing that the estimate took the expected hourly pay below a certain threshold.\n",

For example, my hourly rate for this hit itself has dropped lower than I like because of the extra time giving this feedback. It'll work out technically being less than US Federal minimum wage for the work. Not complaining about that because I could have chosen not to answer this question, just making the greater point that without knowing what the job pays, estimated time discrepancies are tough to judge alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worth pointing out also, estimates on mturk usually go the other way. Most good workers have maximized their input efficiency and generally have seen most of the boilerplate survey questions that always come up hundreds of times. It's more likely that we'll finish a 10 minute estimate in 5 or 6 minutes if it's routine. Something to consider as you continue your work, and also something to consider if you see others finishing this hit quickly. Getting rejected because we \"work too fast\" is something that really chafes, especially when rejection rate has such a major impact on the quality of work available to us.\n",

I'm wondering if you could construct an algorithm which incorporates each worker's HIT history.  This would have to be iron clad for privacy, truly individual.  I use MTurk Suite and can look stuff up but it's rather clunky and time consuming.  I cannot venture much further into the various scripts, too complicated for me (71 years old / 14,200 approvals).\n",

Sometimes I allowed a small margin of error because I felt that I could get better and improve my time. But most HIT's timed at 5 seconds need to be done that fast in order for them to make sense for the worker. Being told something takes 3 minutes and it takes 5 is highly disappointing, being told 45 and it takes 47; not so much.\n",
